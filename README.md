# shopify-borderfree-converter

This is a script that will take in a standard Shopify Product Export and create a 
tab delimeted text file for use in the Border Free Global Commerce system.

Obviously the variables and the formatting are specific to our specific case.

I'm sharing this in hopes that someone can use it to save some time in their own 
implementation.
